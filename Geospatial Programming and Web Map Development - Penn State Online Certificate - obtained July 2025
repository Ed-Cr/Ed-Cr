This details the curriculum I chose to complete Penn State University's Online Geospatial Programming and Web Map Development Graduate Certificate.

Summer Semester 2024 - GEOG 485: GIS Programming and Software Development
  - REFERENCE webpage: https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog485/ 
  - INSTRUCTORS: Panagiotis Giannakis, Jim Detwiler, and Jeff Kling
  - DESCRIPTION: This course focused on solving goegprahic problems by modifying and automating GIS software through programming. Python was the predominant programming language this class focused on. An introductory course this began with the basics on programming
    including object-oriented programming, component object model technologies, object model diagrams, loops, if-then constructs, and modular code design.
  - FINAL PROJECT: the final assignment was to automate a task inside a GIS application using Python. I chose to automate the annual update process for a dataset I maintain using Python to script a custom tool in ArcGIS Pro. The outcome was a custom
    tool that my team can use annually to handle the data cleaning for state specific designations for disadvantaged communities. The tool would generate the updated dataset factoring in the changes in local demographics.
    This dataset fed a report my agency is legally required to provide to the general assembly every three years.

Fall Semester 2024 - GEOG 863: Web Application Development for Geospatial Professionals
  - REFERENCE: https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog863/
  - INSTRUCTORS: Jimmy Kroon,  Jim Detwiler, James O'Brien
  - DESCRIPTION: Focus was how to build applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Topics covered included implementation of 2D maps and 3D scenes, working with APIs, understanding API documentation, layer discovery and visualization,
    user interface development, data querying, and geoprocessing. Over the course of this class I developed a portfolio of projects consisting of increasingly more complex tasks.
  - FINAL PROJECT: I developed a web map of Virginia's energy resources. This displayed current energy infrastructure, energy potential, and the energy profile of Virginia. The data was included using the Energy Information Administration's API
    and the Virginia Geospatial Information Network.

Spring Semester 2025 - GEOG 585: Open Web Mapping
  - REFERENCE: https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog585/
  - INSTRUCTORS: Panagiotis Giannakis, George Adams
  - DESCRIPTION: This class focused on working with web services, gaining experience developing web maps with FOSS. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were the main programming languages discussed in this class. Leaflet's API as the predominant FOSS GIS tool
    used in this course.
  - FINAL PROJECT: I developed a web map using Leaflet's API that displayed the electricity demand of Virginia's government fleets. This involved creating a custom basemap using QGIS, developing a GUI and web map using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    The final map included an interactive slider that allowed users to display the electricity demand of government fleets through outout the day.

Spring Semester 2025 - GEOG 588: Analytial Approaches for Spatial Data Science
  - REFERENCE: https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog588/
  - INSTRUCTORS: Marcela Suarez
  - DESCRIPTION: This course focused on spatial data science, modeling geographic phenomena, and developing coding solutions for lab exercises.
    R was the primary programming language taught in this class using R Studios as the IDE. 
  - FINAL PROJECT: my final project involved analyzing electric vehicle tourism economic impacts in Virginia. Estmiating the number of travelers visiting Virginia that were driving electric vehicles, analyzing the most visited tourism locations
    to determine how many electric vehicle owners visited each tourism site each year, and estimate how much tourism revenue is being generated from electric vehicle drivers. This project was created in R Studios and utilized data provided by
    the Virginia Tourism Corporation.

Summer Semester 2025 - GEOG 489: Advanced Python Programming for GIS
  - REFERENCE: https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog489/
